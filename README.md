# Packet-Tracer-Project
In this project I will be testing the knowledge I have learned from my CCNA studies using JeremysIT lab course on YouTube and Implementing it into a Campus Area Network Project. I first began by creating multiple departments such as HR, IT, Security and using Variable Length Subnetting (VLSM) to divide my address space efficiently.
